### Project Background
We want to create a social media service to view, interact, and track what entertainment and product release dates your friends are looking forward to.

### Problem Statement
Thereâ€™s no universal website or app that lets you track release dates. 

### Inadeqacy of current solutions
Right now we have to check multiple different websites and then keep track of it on a calendar - which possibly merges it with work and personal related events. There are too many different sources of information to view and apps to own to find this information. There is also no current way to see what your friends are looking forward to.

### Background skills and interests applicable to the project
Our all inclusive experience pool includes  HTML, C#, C++, Java, Matlab, Web development, Javascript, and Perl. We all are interested in Movies, TV Shows, video games, etc. and want one way to keep track of upcoming releases.

### Approach, goals, and expectations
Our approach is right now is to start with a mockup of the interface, build a database of release dates, work on the backend, then finalize the front end. Team expectations are to create an interactive showcase of release dates for multiple categories of entertainment/product.
