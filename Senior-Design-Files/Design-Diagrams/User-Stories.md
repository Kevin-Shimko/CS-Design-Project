As a **movie fan,** I want to **see which of my friends are looking forward to a movie**, so that **I can go see it with them.**

As a **media consumer,** I want to **know when movies and games are coming out in the same app,** so that **I donâ€™t need to have multiple sources.**

As a **organized person,** I want to **keep track of multiple release dates,** so that **I can plan my schedule accordingly.**

As a **TV fan,** I want to **get notifications when a TV show comes out,** so that  **I keep up to date.**
